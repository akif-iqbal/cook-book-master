You can also add regular green cabbage instead of red or purple cabbage. Then add the dry ingredients – 2 tablespoons corn starch, 2 tablespoons all purpose flour (maida), ½ teaspoon black pepper and ½ teaspoon salt or add as required. Mix and gather the whole mixture together. Then kind of mix and knead so that the veggies leave the water and you get a dough-like mixture. But do not knead like that a bread or roti dough. Gluten strands can form that will give a dense chewy texture in the fried veggie balls. So just mix very well and press so that the veggies release their juices. Then take a small portion of the mixture in your hands.Press and roll it in your palm and make a round veggie ball. Make all veggie balls this way and keep aside. You can spread some oil on your palms while making the vegetable balls. Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. Add a small piece of a ball to the hot oil. If the balls does not stick or settle down at the bottom of the pan, but comes up steadily the oil is ready for frying these veggie balls. If the balls break, then some more binding agent is required. So you can add 2 to 3 teaspoons of some more all-purpose flour (maida).Gently place the balls in the hot oil. The oil has to be medium hot. Too much heat and the manchurian balls will be browned from top and uncooked from inside. Less hot oil will make the balls absorb too much oil.When cooked from one side, turn the balls with a slotted spoon.  Fry the balls till crisp and golden turning them over a couple of times. Remove them with a slotted or perforated spoon and drain as much as oil as possible. Place the fried manchurian balls on kitchen paper towels.

Add 4 tablespoons chopped spring onions (scallions), 1 tablespoon finely chopped ginger, 1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic, 2 green chilies (finely chopped) and ¼ cup finely chopped capsicum (green bell pepper). Adding capsicum is optional. You can use toasted sesame oil or sunflower oil or any neutral tasting oil. Stir fry on medium flame till the onions turn translucent.Now add the mixed sauces.Stir and mix very well. Add 1 to 1.25 cups water. Let the mixture come to a boil. Mix the corn flour paste again in the bowl (as the corn flour settles at the bottom) and then add in the pan. As soon as you add corn flour paste, mix very well so that there are no lumps. Continue to stir and mix when the manchurian gravy is cooking. Simmer till the manchurian sauce thickens and you see a glaze in it. There should be no raw taste of the cornflour in the sauce. Cooking sauce or gravy takes about 3 to 4 minutes on a medium flame. If the sauce is too thick, then you add some water. If it is too thin, then you can add some cornflour.

    { id: 10, name: 'Schezuan Fried Rice', recipe:"Rinse the basmati rice, till the water runs clear of the starch. Then soak the rice in water for 30 mins. Drain and keep aside. Bring water, salt and a few drops of oil to a gentle boil.Add the drained soaked rice. Simmer on a low flame, till the rice grains are just cooked.  Strain the rice in a colander. Rinse the rice with water so that the rice grains stop cooking. Gently with your hands, move the cooked rice grains, while rinsing them with water. Drain completely. Cover and keep aside. Chop all the vegetables finely. Remember to chop the french beans very finely. They take more time to cook than other veggies. You can also blanch them first and then cook. Another option is to add the beans first and then add the other vegetables.Heat oil in a pan. Add the chopped garlic and saute for about 15 to 20 seconds. Now increase the flame to its highest, add all the vegetables including the spring onions and celery. Keep on stirring the veggies, till they start getting browned from the edges. It took me about 9 minutes for the vegetables to cook. Now add the schezwan sauce. Stir well. Add the rice in parts and keep on stirring. Stir gently as you don’t want the rice grains to break. Season with salt, pepper and vinegar. Mix and stir fry for 2 to 3 minutes tossing the rice so that the sauce coats each and every rice grain well. Check the taste and add more salt, pepper and schezwan sauce if required. Garnish with spring onion greens and Serve the schezwan fried rice hot with any Indo Chinese sauce like mushroom manchurian or gobi manchurian.", url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUhyJPJlfS8" },
